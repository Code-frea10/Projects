    // creating  a new method
    // most important thing in creating a method is that method are always in the inside of the class

    // example:
    private static void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I love Java Programming "); // emthy because the main method is the main invoking when running the program
        // we need to call this method to the main method
    }
